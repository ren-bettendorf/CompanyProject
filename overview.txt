# Company Project Management System Assignment

This project is for the first assignment in Colorado State University CS 414 Online Course demonstrating an understanding of UML design and TDD approach.

It uses JUnit 4 for TDD and was created using the Eclipse IDE.

I did have some problems getting some of the tests to only use the main function being tested, but in the end I did have them all tested with multiple test cases taking into account different User Case scenarios. Also, I had problems getting the tests to run the JUnit Test Runner outside of Eclipse but once I have it running I don’t see any problems with this going forward. 

The compile command line code I used was:
java -cp /usr/share/java/junit.jar:/usr/share/java/hamcrest/core.jar:. cs414/a1/rbetten/*.java

To run the Test Suite:
java -cp /usr/share/java/junit.jar:/usr/share/java/hamcrest/core.jar:. cs414.a1.rbetten.TestAll

My file structure is as follows and is needed to run (I put the files on the root such as):
~/cs414/a1/rbetten/*.java

If you have any questions about anything please don’t hesitate to email be at renaldorini@gmail.com.

Thanks!
